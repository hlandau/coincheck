=========
IRC ticker bot written in Go. Uses Bitcoinity's HTML5 server-sent-event JSON
HTTP feed for live updates without polling.

This is the first thing I've written in Go, so it's probably not very well
written.

The IRC implementation is fairly basic and may need tweaking for different
networks. Tested with Charybdis ircd and Atheme services.

Usage
-----
Rename ticker.json.example to ticker.json and edit it to configure connection
details. Run `go build` to build and run `./irc`.

Licence
-------
Licenced under the MIT License. Patches welcome.
