coincheck
=========
IRC ticker bot written in Go. Uses Bitcoinity's HTML5 server-sent-event JSON
HTTP feed for live updates without polling.

This is the first thing I've written in Go, so it's probably not very well
written.

The IRC implementation is fairly basic and may need tweaking for different
networks. Tested with Charybdis ircd and Atheme services.

Customization
-------------
Currently outputs only the 'last' price for USD, but should be very easy to
customise. The entire JSON output of the feed is available.

Design
------
Features a custom HTTP implementation, because go's HTTP implementation didn't
seem suitable. The implementation is ultra-minimal and is currently hardcoded
for Bitcoinity's ticker feed.

Usage
-----
Rename ticker.json.example to ticker.json and edit it to configure connection
details. Run `go build` to build and run `./coincheck`.

TODO
----
- Add resilience for when the feed dries up. Occasionally a stream stops
  sending events.
- Add resilience for when disconnected from IRC.
- Make feed URL configurable.
